          ClusterCIDR represents a single configuration for per-Node Pod CIDR
          allocations when the MultiCIDRRangeAllocator is enabled (see the config for
          kube-controller-manager).  A cluster may have any number of ClusterCIDR
          resources, all of which will be considered when allocating a CIDR for a
          Node.  A ClusterCIDR is eligible to be used for a given Node when the node
          selector matches the node in question and has free CIDRs to allocate.  In
          case of multiple matching ClusterCIDR resources, the allocator will attempt
          to break ties using internal heuristics, but any ClusterCIDR whose node
          selector matches the Node may be used.
